The V-shape intuition in this problem comes from the observation that as you try different values for x (the target number you are converting all elements to), the total conversion cost first decreases, reaches a minimum, and then starts increasing again. This creates a V-shaped cost function.

Let’s break down this idea further:

1. Cost Function Behavior:
The cost function for converting all elements in nums to some target number x is defined as:


cost(x)=∑∣nums[i]−x∣×cost[i]
This is the sum of the absolute differences between x and each number in nums, weighted by the corresponding cost array. Here's how the cost behaves as x changes:

When x is far from the median of nums:
If x is far from most of the numbers in the array, the absolute differences |nums[i] - x| will be large for most values of i. Since each difference is multiplied by cost[i], the total cost will be high.

As x moves closer to the median:
As x approaches the "center" or median of the nums array, the differences |nums[i] - x| become smaller for more and more numbers. Consequently, the total cost decreases, because the weighted differences shrink.

When x is beyond the median:
As you move x further past the median, the differences start increasing again, making the total cost rise. This is because now most of the numbers are on the other side of x, leading to larger absolute differences.

2. V-Shape Formation:
This behavior of the cost function gives rise to a V-shape curve. Here's why:

Left of the minimum:
When x is too small (i.e., on the left of the optimal x), increasing x reduces the total cost. This part of the curve slopes downwards, representing a decrease in cost as you get closer to the optimal value.

Right of the minimum:
Once x exceeds the optimal value, further increasing x starts to increase the cost again. This part of the curve slopes upwards, representing an increase in cost.

Minimum point:
The lowest point on the V-shape is the optimal x, where the total cost is minimized. This is the point where the absolute differences between x and nums[i] are distributed in such a way that the weighted sum is the smallest possible.

3. V-Shape in Binary Search:
In the binary search algorithm, you're leveraging this V-shaped behavior to efficiently find the minimum cost:

Mid-point comparison:
At each step of the binary search, you compute the cost at two points: mid and mid + 1. Based on the relative values of cost(mid) and cost(mid + 1), you determine which side of the V-shape you're on.

If cost(mid) < cost(mid + 1), you're on the right side of the V-shape (descending part). This means you could be near the minimum, but you should continue searching to the left to potentially find a smaller cost.

If cost(mid) >= cost(mid + 1), you're on the left side of the V-shape (ascending part). This means the cost is still decreasing, so you should move right to find the minimum.

By continuing this comparison, you "home in" on the minimum point of the V-shape using binary search.

4. Visualizing the V-Shape:
Imagine the cost function plotted on a graph with x on the x-axis (the value you're converting all numbers to) and the total conversion cost on the y-axis.

On the left side of the graph, when x is smaller than the optimal value, the curve slopes downwards (cost decreases).
In the middle, at the optimal x, the curve reaches the bottom of the V (minimum cost).
On the right side of the graph, when x is larger than the optimal value, the curve slopes upwards (cost increases).

The goal of the binary search is to quickly find the lowest point on this V-shaped curve.

5. Why Binary Search Works:
Binary search is effective here because the cost function has this V-shaped structure.
Since the cost either decreases or increases monotonically as you move left or right from the minimum, binary search can discard half the search space at each step based on whether you're on the left or right side of the V.

Minimum cost depends on much each number is far from the central number (x) and what is the associated cost to reach x. This implies weighted value of each number where the decision to choose it as x is determined both by its value and the associated cost
x will be between [m, M] where m = min(nums), M = max(nums). Use binary search to find the cost to convert every number to x
The further other numbers will be from x, the further their cost of conversion will be, thus the conversion cost function (f) will be a v-shape curve, whose minima is what we are interested in
if f(t) < f(t+1), then this could be x, save it and keep looking to left of t as you could be on the right arm of the v-curve
else if f(t) >= f(t+1), this means you're on the left arm of the v-curve, this is not the point of interest so keep looking to the right
Once x is found. return the cost for converting every nums[i] to it
T/S: O(n lg r)/O(1), where n = size(nums), r = max(nums) - min(nums)

public long minCost(int[] nums, int[] cost) {
	var left = Arrays.stream(nums).min().getAsInt();
	var right = Arrays.stream(nums).max().getAsInt();
	var weightedMedian = 0;

	while (left <= right) {
		var mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
		var midCost = weightedCost(nums, cost, mid);
		var nextCost = weightedCost(nums, cost, mid + 1);

		if (midCost < nextCost) {
			weightedMedian = mid;
			right = mid - 1;
		} else {
			left = mid + 1;
		}
	}

	return weightedCost(nums, cost, weightedMedian);
}

private long weightedCost(int[] nums, int[] cost, int mid) {y
	var distance = 0L;

	for (var i = 0; i < nums.length; i++)
		distance += (long) Math.abs(nums[i] - mid) * cost[i];

	return distance;
